  "summary": "All three requirements have been fully implemented. The diff shows proper ICRC-1 Account type definitions with subaccount as optional array field, account construction using getDefaultAccount helper with subaccount: [], comprehensive debug logging, and consistent usage across frontend components (useInfinityCoinBalance, SendPage, ReceivePage).",

      "description": "Addition of getDefaultAccount helper function in lib/infinityLedger",
      "reason": "The BuildRequest does not specify creating a getDefaultAccount helper function. The requirement only mentions fixing account object construction directly in the hook and ensuring type definitions match ICRC-1 spec. While this is a reasonable implementation detail, it was not requested.",
