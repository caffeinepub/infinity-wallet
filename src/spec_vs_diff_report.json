  "summary": "The diff successfully implements both requirements to fix Principal serialization issues in the ckBTC minter hooks. REQ-1 is addressed by modifying useCkBtcDepositAddress to pass empty arrays for optional owner/subaccount fields instead of serialized Principal objects. REQ-2 is addressed similarly in useCkBtcDepositStatus. Both hooks now let the minter use the caller's principal by default when owner is not specified. The changes align with the build request constraints and acceptance criteria.",
