  "summary": "The implementation partially addresses the requirements. The backend creates an exchange rate service fetching from ICPSwap, the frontend displays USD values in TotalAssetsDisplay and individual BalanceCards, and the 'Exchange rate conversion not yet implemented' note appears to have been removed. However, there is no explicit evidence that the removed disclaimer text was present in the original UI, and the implementation hardcodes a mock rate for Infinity Coin rather than fetching it from ICPSwap as specified.",

    {
      "description": "Hardcoded mock exchange rate for Infinity Coin (0.01 USD) instead of fetching from ICPSwap oracle",
      "reason": "REQ-1 specifies that exchange rates for all tokens including Infinity Coin must be fetched from ICPSwap oracle. The implementation explicitly sets rates for Infinity Coin to 0.01 with a comment stating it is a mock rate since it is not on ICPSwap yet, which contradicts the requirement.",
