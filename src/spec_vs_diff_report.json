  "summary": "The diff does not show a revert to a prior known-good version; instead it adds/changes frontend functionality (Oisy wallet flows, new error boundary, new smoke-test checklist doc, and other UI/feature work). There is no evidence of backend reversion or of the deployment-failing changes being undone.",

      "requirement": "Revert the application codebase (frontend + backend) to the most recent known-good version that successfully deployed, undoing the changes that led to the current deployment failure.",
      "reason": "The diff shows new/modified frontend code and new files being added, but provides no evidence of reverting to a previous known-good state, nor any backend changes/reverts. The change set appears additive rather than a rollback.",
