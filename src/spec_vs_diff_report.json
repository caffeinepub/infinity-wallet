  "summary": "All three requirements (REQ-1, REQ-2, REQ-3) appear to be implemented in the diff. REQ-1 and REQ-2 are addressed through changes to frontend/src/lib/validation.ts (formatBalance and formatUSD functions with 12 decimal places for small values). REQ-3 is addressed through error handling improvements in useCkBtcDepositStatus.ts. However, the actual TotalAssetsDisplay and BalanceCard components themselves are not shown in the diff, so implementation completeness cannot be fully verified.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Modify the TotalAssetsDisplay component to format USD values with sufficient decimal places",
      "reason": "The TotalAssetsDisplay component file is not present in the diff. While validation.ts shows formatUSD function changes with 12 decimal precision, we cannot verify if TotalAssetsDisplay actually uses this updated function.",
      "evidence": []
    },
    {
      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "Apply extended decimal precision formatting to BalanceCard component",
      "reason": "The BalanceCard component file is not present in the diff. While validation.ts provides the formatting utilities, we cannot verify if BalanceCard imports and uses them.",
