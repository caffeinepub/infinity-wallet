  "summary": "The diff adds a new authenticated Receive screen that derives and displays the user’s ICP Ledger Account ID from the current Internet Identity Principal, adds in-app navigation/routing to reach it (including wiring Dashboard navigation), and implements copy-to-clipboard with visible success feedback and English guidance text for exchange deposits. One unrelated change appears to have been made to HistoryPage (timestamp type fix) that wasn’t requested.",
