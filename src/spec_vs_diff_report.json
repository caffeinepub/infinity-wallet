REQ-10 (restyled static branding image assets) is not evidenced in the diff summary; image paths are preserved and still referenced, but no asset file updates are shown. Some non-requested functional changes (copy-to-clipboard principal UI and a timestamp type fix) are present.",

      "reason": "The diff summary shows continued usage of the existing image paths in WalletLogo and Dashboard, but does not show any modified/added static image asset files for the referenced PNGs; only TSX/CSS/config files are modified in the provided summary.",
