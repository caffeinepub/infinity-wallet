# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Reduce UI component size from large to medium throughout the application.

**Planned changes:**
- Scale down buttons, cards, input fields, and text elements from large to medium size
- Adjust spacing and padding to match medium scale proportions
- Ensure layout remains coherent at reduced size

**User-visible outcome:** The application interface displays at a more compact medium size, with all components proportionally scaled down for a less oversized appearance.
