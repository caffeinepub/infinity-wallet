# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Update Infinity Wallet’s UI theme and branding to match the uploaded Infinity Coin logo’s futuristic, neon/digital aesthetic.

**Planned changes:**
- Update theme tokens in `frontend/index.css` (colors, gradients/glows, surfaces, typography, focus/hover states) inspired by `image.png`, keeping readability/accessibility.
- Apply the updated theme consistently across the main layout and all existing screens (Dashboard, Send, Contacts, History), including headers, cards, and forms, without modifying files under `frontend/src/components/ui`.
- Restyle existing static branding assets to match the new futuristic/neon look while keeping existing asset filenames/paths working.

**User-visible outcome:** The wallet UI and branding (logos/icons) have a cohesive futuristic, digitally appealing look consistent with the Infinity Coin logo across all pages.
